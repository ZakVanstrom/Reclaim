This repository contains an in-progress version of a website being built for a family passion.

It's one of my first attempts at combining html, css, and javascript, and is currently acting aiming to be a gallery, idea compiler, name spreader, and digital connector. After completion (and subsequent removal from GitHub Pages) it'll act as a venue for e-commerce.

I'm working pro bono, except for the part where they raised me, feel free to leave comments are share ideas. It's much appreciated :)
